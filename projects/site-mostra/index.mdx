Hello World! This is me learning how to create a full gatsby site, with mdx blog posts and everything that I can!

As this is my first post, I have a few things to say:
* First, I wanna say that I have learn more about markdown, and stuff.
* I also have to search more about GraphQL. For now, I can work with basic stuff, but I feel that there's so much more that I can do.
* Lastly, I have to say that this project is so much easier than anything that I've done with Vue, so far.
