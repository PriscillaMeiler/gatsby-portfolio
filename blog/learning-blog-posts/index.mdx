This is the second learning session for this project. Today I learned how to create a blog listing page, getting data from files, and GraphQL and using in components (useStaticQuery) and pages(query = graphql). I also learned how to get SEO information from gatsby config file.

And by the end of the day, I learned how to create a dynamic page for each post.
